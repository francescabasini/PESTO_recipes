### Painless and Easy Scripts for Time Optimisation
<!-- or shotcuts -->

This repo contains a series of scripts, sometimes just a few lines, to remember how to perform a few not-so-common tasks.

Here is a (hopefully up-to-date) list of scripts:

| Task | File name |Description |
|-----|----|------|
| Package development Python| PackDevPython.md| simple instructions to setup own package development from local folder|
| Python code chunks| Python_chunks folder| Chunks of code to execute a series of handy tasks in Python|
| Webpage routine| WebRoutine.md| simple pipeline to modify/update/deploy your personal webpage |
| VScode shortcuts| VShortcuts.md| list of shortcuts and commands when using VS code|
|Terminal script launch| Terminal_command_script.md| list of commands to launch computing scripts from terminal to run on clusters|
|Latex Templates| LatexTemplates folder| Folder containing my favourite templates for reports, thesis, posters and presentations|
